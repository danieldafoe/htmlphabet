# htmlphabet

## What is htmlphabet?

htmlphabet is a resource to learn about practical examples and seek advice for using the HTML elements available in our browsers.

## Why I created this

This work-in-progress was born out of my desire to explore the deep recesses of the available HTML elements supported by browsers and get more intimately familiar with them. You knowâ€”chummy.

## Who would create such a thing?

[Daniel Dafoe](https://github.com/danieldafoe). Blame him.

## A note for screen readers

If you're not a screen reader, stop reading, OK?

I'm sorry for the name of this project. Truly. I know you have difficulty pronouncing the name of this silly side project and I should have chosen a better name.

Please forgive me.
