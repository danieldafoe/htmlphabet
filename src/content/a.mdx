# &lt;a&gt;, the anchor tag

<img src={bus} alt='' />

Anchor tags are like buses: they take you somewhere.

Similar to how buses can't take actions like buying a lottery ticket or submitting taxes, [anchors don't take actions](https://davidwalsh.name/html5-buttons).

Buses sometimes have digital signs or numbers on them that tell you where they're going; anchors have an `href` attribute for that.

Buses only let you ride if you have a ticket; anchors need an `href` to work.

## Naming your destination

The digital sign on a bus tells you where it's going. We need to tell people where anchor tags take you as well.

Your destination name should be descriptive while being as short as possible.

Buses don't say "Driving to the daycare," they say "Daycare".

<h2 id='html-spec-nav-code-sample'>HTML Specification Code Example</h2>

The [anchor tag HTML specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/dev/text-level-semantics.html#the-a-element) provides the following example for an anchor, noting that you could "surround even whole advertisements" in one.

<CodeSnippet labelId='html-spec-nav-code-sample'>
{`
<nav>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="/news">News</a></li>
    <li><a>Examples</a></li>
    <li><a href="/legal">Legal</a</li>
  </ul>
</nav>
`}
</CodeSnippet>

What do screen readers think of this? They treat anchors without a destination as plain text.
